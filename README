This package allows a programmer to compile a Makefile-based project
for the following platforms:
  - iOS Simulator (i386)
  - iOS Devices (armv6 and armv7)
  - iOS Framework (fat framework: i386, armv6 and armv7)

How to use the package:

- Copy the Canonical.Framework.tar and makeframework.sh files to
  the directory containing the makefile that you want to use

- Go to the directory containing the makefile and run makeframework.sh

Example:

./makeframework.sh -v 1.6.7 framework --disable-gost --disable-sha2 --without-ssl

This will configure and make the project into a static library framework
using the options "--disable-gost --disable-sha2 --without-ssl",
and give it version number 1.6.7.

The output will be located in ${HOME}/compiles/iPhoneFramework
